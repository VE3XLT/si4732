USER MANUAL

Features

* Modes: FM, AM and SSB
* Two FM bands covering from 64 to 108 MHz
* LW band
* Two MW bands (one for Europe, Africa and Asia)
* Twenty three bands. Two VHF(FM); one LW; two MW; and Nineteen SW bands covering from 1800 to 30000 kHz
* FM/RDS
* Bandwidth control on FM mode (Auto, 110, 84, 60 and 40 kHz)
* Bandwidth control on AM mode (1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 6 kHz)
* Bandwidth control on SSB mode (0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4 kHz)
* Receiver status stored into the EEPROM
* The final code (HEX file) is about 2.5K smaller than the previous one (now  you have more memory to add new features)
* All the previous status of the receiver can be rescued when you turn it on (including SSB mode, bandwidth, volume, frequency, BFO etc)
* The bandwidth is a property of the band (you can use different bandwidth for different bands)
* The seek function was improved (it is more precise on FM mode). The seek direction is controlled by the encoder (clockwise or counter-clockwise . Press encoder push button for seeking
* Steps: 1, 5, 9, 10 and 50 kHz
* Now you can configure MW band space to 9 or 10 kHz
* Added a MW band for Europe, Africa and Asia
* The frequency on Display is bigger than the previous version
* Now the bandwidth sequence is ordered by bandwidth values
* After about 4 seconds, all command buttons are all disabled and the encoder control goes back to the frequency


COMMANDS

1) DEALING WITH AUDIO VOLUME

Press the __"VOL+"__ push button and rotate the  encoder. Press the button again to disable the command or wait for 4s;


2) SELECTING THE BAND

Press the __"BAND+"__ push button and rotate the  encoder. Press the button again to disable the command or wait for 4s;

3) DEALING WITH AGC AND ATTENUATION

Press the AGC push button and rotate the  encoder. Press the button again to disable the command or wait for 4s;

4) DEALING WITH SOFTMUTE AND ATTENUATION

Press the push button labeled __"BAND-"__ and rotate the  encoder. Press the button again to disable the command or wait for 4s. This button was used to control the band switch. Due to the new interface, this button has lost its original function.

5) SELECTING BANDWIDTH

Press the BW  push button and rotate the  encoder. Press the button again to disable the command or wait for 4s;

6) SWITCHING THE STEP FREQUENCY

Press the STEP push button and rotate the  encoder. Press the button again to disable the command or wait for 4s;

7) SWITCHING THE MODE AM, LSB AND USB

On AM mode press MODE push button to switch to LSB mode; press MODE push button again to switch to USB mode; and finally press MODE push button again to switch AM mode.

8) VFO/BFO Switch

To control the VFO and BFO, you can use the encoder push button on SSB mode. The display will show you if you are using VFO or BFO.

9) SEEK COMMAND

On FM or AM modes press the encoder push button.
The direction of the seek up or seek down will  depend on the last rotating movement of the encoder, clockwise and counterclockwise respectively.

10) RESET EEPROM

Turn your receiver on with the encoder push button pressed.
